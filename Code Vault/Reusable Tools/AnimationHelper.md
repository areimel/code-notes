# AnimationHelper - Swiper.js


This is a supplementary component/plugin built on top of Swiper.js, my primary slider/slideshow/carousel plugin of choice. It shows relevant data about the current live state of the Swiper instance, and can be used to assist in creating animations around the Swiper elements and to help better understand exactly what the state of the slider is at what times.
