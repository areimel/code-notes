# Advanced UTM Tracker
Plugin Documentation/Marketing Notes

Feature: ==UTM/Form Integration==
Selling points:
- ==Double-check your marketing vendor's work.== 
	- Get real, accurate numbers on your conversions by using your form submissions as a secondary data stream. 
	- If there's a major discrepancy in the numbers, you have data to back it up.
- ==More accurate than standard UTM-based conversion tracking. ==
	- Save UTMs for the whole browsing session and get conversion data on users who leave the initial page.
	- Get UTM data from users who:
		- Navigated to a different page
		- Browsed through multiple pages
		- Closed their tab and came back to the site
		- Closed their browser or shut down their computer and came back to the site later
		- Users who left the site and come back hours/days/weeks later
	- Catch conversions you weren't catching before
		- Vendors: "your campaigns may actually be performing X% better than you think, and you just don't know."
	- ==POSSIBLE TO CATCH CONVERSIONS FROM AD-BLOCK USERS==
		- Possible major selling point
		- Major feature that vendors are lacking
- ==Direct user attribution==
	- Don't settle for anonymous conversions - by including the UTM data in the form submission, you see what ad, social media post, or email link that specific user came from.
