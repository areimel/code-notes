# Current Projects

Quick reference for currently-active github repos because I have too many

Mixed Freelance/Work:
- `analytics-plugin-bundle`: working files for Custom Events, UTM Tracking, and Dynamic Content plugins - formerly `planet-caravan-analytics-toolkit`, migrated to Astro project for better testing capabilities & component structure.
- `plugin-demo-collection`: public demo and documentation site for plugin collection(s) - shares code with `analytics-plugin-bundle`, should be able to swap components back & forth. Plugins should be set up as regular public 3rd party plugins for this site, not directly in the source code.

Work Repos:
- `kiosk-public-demo`: The Grovery version of the KIOSK site program, meant as a publicly viewable demo.
- `core-public-demo`: Grovery-branded version of CORE site template, meant to be a publicly viewable example of CORE

Personal Repos:
- `interzone-web-marketing`: alt freelance brand concept
- `writers-blog`: website for (re)hosting short stories and writing using a blog-style template. Purpose 1: rehosting Weird Lit/SciFi stories that might become unavailable in the future

Micro-Projects:
- `utm-link-builder`
- `qr-code-generator`
- `hubspot-forms`
